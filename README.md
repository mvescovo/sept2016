#Java Desktop Weather App

Main Features:
- Select any Australian weather station (based on BOM list).
- View some history for a selected weather station.
- View some forecasts for a selected weather station.
- See that data in the form of a chart.
- Refresh the currently displayed weather data.
- Save weather stations to a favourite list.
- Remove a weather station from the favourite list.

Notes:
- This project was for educational purposes and not intended as a _real_ app.
- The current version is incomplete and partly broken. Only two stations are available due to missing lat/lon data. This is an issue due to one of the weather API's requiring this and not offereing a city name option.
